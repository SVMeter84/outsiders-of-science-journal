      <h2>About the Journal</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Outsiders of Science Journal</strong> is a peer-reviewed, online-only, open-access publication dedicated to original scientific work that challenges conventional boundaries. We publish quarterly and accept submissions from independent researchers, underrepresented voices, and academic dissidents.
      </p>

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to provide a rigorous yet open forum for high-impact theoretical and experimental science — especially work neglected by mainstream journals due to novelty, interdisciplinarity, or lack of institutional affiliation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Science should never be pay-to-play.</strong> This journal will always be free to read and free to publish in. Knowledge belongs to everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Why "Outsiders of Science"?</h2>
      <p>
        Many transformative ideas in science began outside academic orthodoxy. We recognize that gatekeeping can hinder progress, and that the future of physics, biology, cosmology, and other fields may emerge from bold thinkers who refuse to wait for permission. This journal is for them.
      </p>
